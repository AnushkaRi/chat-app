# Chat App - Algebra Final Project

A single-page chat application built with React and Scaledrone.

Technologies used: React.js, Redux and Scaledrone.

This project was build within 12 days of learning React.js and Redux by doing and coding. The result represents core features of a social network.

For me this was a good opportunity to gather more practical experience with asychronous JavaScript (using Promises and async/await) as well as with database queries - and to explore React, a very powerful framework for building single-page applications.
